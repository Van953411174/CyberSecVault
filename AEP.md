ATT&CK Emulation Plans are a step-by-step guide on how to mimic specific threat groups. As of April 30th, 2021, there are 3 #AEP's currently available:
- [**APT3**](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/adversary-emulation-plans/)
- [**APT29**](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/apt29) 
- [**FIN6**](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/fin6)

Its worth noting that the Adversary Emulation Library does contain additional plans but I have not confirmed their completion. 

An #ATTCK Emulation is in the pipeline for **FIN7**
