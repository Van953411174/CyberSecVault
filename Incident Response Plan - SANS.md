# IR Plan - SANS
1. Preparation
	1. Review/codify org sec policy
	2. Risk assessments
	3. CSIRT established
	4. Critical incidents established
2. Identification
	1. Monitor and detect deviations
	2. Collect evident establish incident type and severity
3. Containment
	1. short term containment -> long-term containment
	2. isolating network segments
	3. fixes to systems to allow normal operations
	4. start or prepping clean systems
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
	1. bring prod sys back up
	2. test, verify and monitor
6. Lessons learned


## 1. Preparation
Goal is to ensure that org can response to an incident

- Policy
- Response Plan/Strategy
- Communication
- Documentation
- Team
- Access Control
- Training
- Tools


## 2. Identification
Detecting deviations from normal operations in the org, understanding if a deviation represents a security incident, and determining how important the incident is. 

- Setting up monitoring
- Analyzing Events
- Identifying an Incident
- Notifying CSIRT members
- Documenting everything
- Threat prevention and detection capabilities

## 3. Containment
Limit damage from current incident and prevent further damage. Furthermore preserve and prevent destruction of evidence.

- Short-term containment
- System backup
- Long-term containment


## 4. Eradication
Intended to actually remove malware or other artifacts introduced by attacks

- Reimaging
- Preventing the root cause
- Applying basic security best practices
- Scan for malware

## 5. Recovery
Bring all systems back to full operation, after verifying they are clean and the threat is removed

- Defining time and date to restore operation
- Test and verifying 
- Monitoring
- Do everything to prevent another incident

## 6. Lessons Learned
No later than two weeks after end of incident, CSIRT should compile all relevant information about the incident and extract lessons that can help with future incident response activity. 

- Completing documentation
- Publishing an incident report
- Identify ways to improve CSIRT performance
- Establish a benchmark for comparison
- Lessons learned meeting
