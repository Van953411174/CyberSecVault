## Sigcheck
> "**Sigcheck** is a command-line utility that shows file version number, timestamp information, and digital signature details, including certificate chains. It also includes an option to check a fileâ€™s status on VirusTotal, a site that performs automated file scanning against over 40 antivirus engines, and an option to upload a file for scanning."

\- Sigcheck [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck)

### Use Cases:
1. Check for unsigned files in `C:\Windows\System32`, as all files there should be signed. 
	1. `sigcheck -u -e C:\Windows\System32`
		1. `-u` if VirusTotal check is enabled, show files that are unknown by VirusTotal or have non-zero detection, otherwise show only unsigned files
		2. `-e` Scan executable images only (regardless of their extension)
	2. Any results *other* than `No matching files were found` warrents further investigation. 

## Streams
> "The NTFS file system provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information. By default, all data is stored in a file's main unnamed data stream, but by using the syntax 'file:stream', you are able to read and write to alternates."

\- Streams [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams)
