## Components
The GVM framework can be broken down into three distinct sections:
- **Front-End** ( #GSA, Web Interfaces)
	- What the user interacts with when you navigate to OpenVAS in your browser. 
	- Web interfaces built off of Greenbone Security Assistant and make life easier for a analyst or operator when working with OpenVAS or other forms of scanners through the GVM.
- **Back-End** ( #OSP, #OpenVAS, Targets)
	- Back-end infrastructure that will actually be conducting all vulnerability scanning and processing data and NVTs through OpenVAS and GVM. 
		- GVM will be the middle-man between the scanners and the front-end user interfaces
- **Vulnerability/Information Feed** ( #NVT, #SCAP_CERT, User Data, Community Feed)
	- Contains all information and vulnerability tests that come from Greenbone Community feed that will be the main baseline for testing against systems.
	- Can also include User Data in place of Greenbone NVTs and SCAP CERTs.
