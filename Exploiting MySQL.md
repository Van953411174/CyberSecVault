# Exploiting MySQL
Exploiting MySQL can mean a couple of different things, two of which will be covered here:
- Extracting information and cracking stored credentials
- Injection from a client to achieve unauthorized access

## Extracting Information
Extracting information can somewhat be considered [[Enumerating MySQL|enumeration of MySQL]] so it will be linked, and #hash_cracking will be covered [[Hash Cracking|here]]
Below is used when credentials are already known and access can be achieved to the database
### Tools
- MetaSploit
	- #metasploit has a couple modules specifically  around extracting MySQL info
		- `mysql_schemadump`[^1] extracts the schema information from a MySQL DB server
			- Returns table names and all columns names, and that columns type, for that table. 
			- Example :![[Pasted image 20210427211141.png]]
		- `mysql_hashdump` [^2] extracts usernames and encrypted password hashes from a MySQL server and stores them for later cracking
			- Example: ![[Pasted image 20210427211446.png]]
			- Extracted hashes can be [[Hash Cracking|cracked]] using tools like JTR or hashcat

[^2]: module path `auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump`

## Injection 
Injection is a common attack on database systems to extract information or gain access

### Tools
- `sqlsus` open source MySQL injection and takeover tool, written in perl
	- https://tools.kali.org/vulnerability-analysis/sqlsus
- Numerous other tools that aren't MySQL specific, instead focusing on SQL
	- Brief list
		- sqlninja
		- sqlmap
		- sqldict
		- jSQL
- Of course many MetaSploit modules as well


## Bruteforcing
MySQL, like any service with a login, can be brute forced as well.
