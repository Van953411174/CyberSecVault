# Exploiting SMTP
SMTP can provide a foothold to a network seeing as its often an exposed endpoint.

Even if it can't be exploited it can provide useful information via enumeration like usernames, #MTA, and server OS.

## Process
Exploiting of SMTP is largely enumeration. It a target SMTP server for example has an open #SSH connection and obviously an open port running #SMTP, then a valid user [[Enumerating SMTP|enumerated from the SMTP port]] can be used to significantly improve the odds of a [[Bruteforcing SSH|bruteforce SSH]] attack.
