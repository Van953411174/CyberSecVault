# SAML
Security Assertion Markup Language ( #SAML) is a type of Single Sign-On ( #SSO) standard. It defines a set of rules/protocols that allow users to access web applications with a single login. This is possible because those applications (referred to as “Service Providers”) all trust the systems that verify users’ identities (referred to as “Identity Providers”).

Service Providers - These are the systems and applications that users access throughout the day.

Identity Providers - This would be the system that performs user authentication.
