# OAUTH 2.0
#OAuth 2.0 is a standard that apps use to provide client applications with access.

OAuth 2.0 spec has four important roles:

-   The authorization server, which is the server that issues the access token.  
-   The resource owner, normally your application's end-user, that grants permission to access the resource server with an access token.
-   The client, which is the application that requests the access token, and then passes it to the resource server.
-   The resource server, which accepts the access token and must verify that it is valid. In this case, this is your application.
