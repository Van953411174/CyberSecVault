# Malware Analysis

Repo of LIVE malware: https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo

When analyzing malware, it is important to consider the following:
- Point of Entry (PoE)
	- E.g. Was it through spam that e-mail filtering missed?
- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine?
	- I.e Are there any files, processes , or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
- How does the malware perform?
	- Does it attempt to infect other devices?
	- Does it encrypt files or instally anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)
- Can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infections

## Process Of Malware Attack
1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining Persistence (not always)
4. Propagation (not always)
