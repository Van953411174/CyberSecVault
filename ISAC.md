# Information Sharing and Analysis Centers 
Otherwise known as #ISAC, are used to share and exchange various #IOC to obtain #threat_intelligence ( #TI). IOCs can include MD5s, #YARA rules, IPs, and more. They're member-driven orgs, delivering all-hazards threat and mitigation information to asset owners and operators. Can be community-centered or vendor-specific. Include [[Cyber Threat Intelligence]] from threat actors as mitigation information. ISACs maintain situational awareness through sharing. 

There is a [National Council of ISACs](https://www.nationalisacs.org/).

Below is a list of ISACs that can help a blue team
-   [US-CERT](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/)
