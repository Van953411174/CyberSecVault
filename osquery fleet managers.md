# Osquery Fleet Manager
Instead of using Osquery locally to query an endpoint you can query multiple endpoints using whats called a fleet manager.

The original open-source manager Kolide Fleet is no longer supported and has been moved to a commercial product known as **Kolide K2** (see https://www.kolide.com/launcher).

A fork of the original #OSS Kolide Fleet has appeared and is currently being actively maintained. This project is known as [fleet](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet)
